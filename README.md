# Definition By Satrughan Kumar

Background subtraction is an efficient way to localize and obtain the centroid of the connected pixels moving on the foreground despite the prior information of the scene. It is suitable under fixed camera arrangement, which incorporates many vision applications such as object tracking, human monitoring, etc. However, the moving object extraction task becomes sophisticated and challenging due to some annoying factors such as local motion in background (waving tree, rippling water, etc.), camouflage region, sleeping object, which in turn degrades the tracking performance.
